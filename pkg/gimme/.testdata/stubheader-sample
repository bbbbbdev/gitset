# These are versions which are passed to runtests, on each architecture, for CI
# testing.  These do not need to be authoritative.
#
# Listing all versions ever provides for quadratic test runtime as we expand
# architectures and OSes.  So we no longer do that.
#
# Instead we include:
#  * all versions of the current release series
#  * the last formal release in all previous series
